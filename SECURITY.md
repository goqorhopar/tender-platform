To help us better understand the nature and scope of the issue, please include as much of the following information as possible:

- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### What to Expect

After you submit your report:

1. **Acknowledgment**: You will receive an acknowledgment of your report within 24 hours.
2. **Triage**: The security team will review and triage your report, typically within 48 hours.
3. **Validation**: If the vulnerability is confirmed, we will validate it internally.
4. **Fix Development**: A fix will be developed and tested in a private repository.
5. **Release**: A new version with the fix will be released as soon as possible.
6. **Disclosure**: Details of the vulnerability will be disclosed after the fix is released.

## Security Measures

### Authentication and Authorization

- Strong password requirements with complexity rules
- Multi-factor authentication support
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Session management with secure tokens
- Account lockout after failed attempts

### Data Protection

- Encryption at rest for sensitive data
- TLS encryption for data in transit
- Secure password hashing with bcrypt
- Regular security audits
- Data backup and recovery procedures

### Input Validation

- Comprehensive input sanitization
- Protection against SQL injection
- Protection against cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Protection against cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse

### Dependencies

- Regular dependency scanning for known vulnerabilities
- Automated security updates where possible
- Dependency pinning to specific versions
- Removal of unused dependencies

### Infrastructure Security

- Container isolation with Docker
- Network segmentation
- Regular security patching
- Intrusion detection systems
- Firewall configuration

## Best Practices

### For Developers

- Follow secure coding practices
- Validate all user inputs
- Sanitize output data
- Use parameterized queries
- Handle errors gracefully without exposing sensitive information
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Run security scans regularly

### For System Administrators

- Keep all software up to date
- Monitor logs for suspicious activity
- Implement proper access controls
- Regularly backup data
- Test disaster recovery procedures
- Use strong authentication mechanisms

## Incident Response

In the event of a security incident:

1. **Detection**: Identify and confirm the incident
2. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems to prevent further damage
3. **Investigation**: Determine the scope and impact of the incident
4. **Eradication**: Remove the threat and close security gaps
5. **Recovery**: Restore systems to normal operation
6. **Lessons Learned**: Document the incident and improve processes

## Third-Party Services

When integrating with third-party services:

- Evaluate the security posture of the service
- Use secure API keys and authentication
- Monitor third-party service status
- Have contingency plans for service outages
- Regularly review third-party access permissions

## Compliance

The Tender Platform follows industry best practices and complies with relevant regulations including:
